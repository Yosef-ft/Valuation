## Dividend Discount Model (DDM)
### Overview
The Dividend Discount Model (DDM) is a fundamental analysis technique used to value a company's stock price based on the present value of its expected future dividend payments. This project utilizes the average growth rate of the dividend growth to forecast 5 years of data and calculate the DDM.

### Features
- Forecasts 5 years of dividend payments using the average growth rate
- Calculates the intrinsic value of the stock based on the DDM
- Compares the intrinsic value to the current market price to determine if the stock is overpriced or underpriced, given the required rate of return
- Uses the pandas, numpy, and yfinance libraries for data processing and analysis
